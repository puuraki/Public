C++
This program was made to see how shared memory works between processes in Linux systems using C++. The program forks into parent and child processes, and uses semaphores to synchronize them. The parent will ask the user to input an integer value. After the value has been entered, the parent will share it with the child process through the shared memory and the child will calculate the factorial of the value. After this the result is returned through shared memory to parent, which will then output it to user. Both processes will keep running until a negative value is given.
