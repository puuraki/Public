C#, C++
The project consists of client for Windows (Visual C#) and server (Linux C++) programs which communicate through TCP socket (port 4360). The idea was to try to get multiple concurrent connections to the server to work, so the client is a basic program that only sends addition or substraction calculations to be solved in the server after connecting. The server will fork into parent and child processes after connection is made, and the parent will let the child take full control of the socket, after which the parent will always ask if the program should continue ("no" will stop the program). Only after giving an answer will the program be able to accept new connections. While not the most useful in its current form, the purpose was only to get multiple connections to work.
