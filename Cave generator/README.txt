MonoGame, C#
This project was made to try out using Life-like (Conway's Game of Life) cellular automata in procedurally generating an endless cave-like map as player advances. Tiles around player are loaded from files or generated and saved if they don't exist and unloaded as player gets further from them.
The program was made in C# and in MonoGame for Visual Studio.
