C#
The web server was made in Visual C# and it uses the port 8080. After starting the server, the user can access the index page locally through http://localhost:8080/index/ which will serve the index.html file.
Filling (or not filling) the form in the index page and submitting it load to a welcome page with the submitted information.
Clicking the "request a page" button will serve a new page for the user.
Both the index.html and test.html need to be in the same folder as the executable (for example http-server/bin/debug if debugging the solution).
