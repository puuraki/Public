Java, Android
This was an assignment in which the purpose was to create an Android app with Android Studio. The app needed to contain four views (or fragments): Main, GPS, Accelerometer, About.
The app outputs real time data of the sensors and the user can access them by swiping left in the main view. The about page can be accessed through the menu on top right of the app.
